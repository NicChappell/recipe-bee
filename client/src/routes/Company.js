            <p>Vision Statement: This is what your company aspires to be; which can be much different than what a company is (mission statement). When done right, your vision statement can and should help drive decisions and goals in your company.</p>
            <p>Our vision is to reduce barriers to nutritious foods. People all over the world face a multitude of challenges on a daily basis. When forced with decisions about how and where to focus your attention, it can be convenient to fall back on a trip to McDonald's for dinner instead of preparing a meal primarily composed of produce and minimally processed foodstuffs. It can be a chore to think of a meal that will make everyone in the family happy. etc...</p>
